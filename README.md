CHATURBATOR 0.5

Chaturbator.py is simple, yet strangely fun python code, made to run in Mac OS Terminal. It will randomly generate and read out loud fun historic facts, but can be set to chaturbate on any other topic ;)

IMPORTANT:
You need to have Ollama server installed and running (get it at https://ollama.ai/). You will also need to edit Chaturbator.py, before using it, to set your LLM Model (in line 8) and set the topic (in line 12).
